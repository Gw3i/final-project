#### Tech Stack:
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

For the development of this application, I selected Next.js, an extension of React, as the overarching framework for both the Frontend and Backend. It's versatile, superior performance, and efficiency in terms of speed and build times.
To enhance the application's robustness and minimize errors in production, TypeScript was implemented as a superset for JavaScript, ensuring type safety throughout the development process.
Authentication was integrated using NextAuth, a specialized authentication library designed specifically for Next.js, ensuring a secure and streamlined user authentication process.
For database interactions, I opted for Primas, a reliable Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, simplifying data retrieval and manipulation.
In addressing performance considerations, I implemented advanced caching strategies utilizing Redis to store exchange and asset data. This strategic use of caching not only reduced loading times on the frontend but also contributed to an overall enhanced user experience.
In terms of styling, Tailwind and SASS were chosen over the more conventional StyledComponents in my opinion for their perceived advantages in developer experience and codebase readability.
